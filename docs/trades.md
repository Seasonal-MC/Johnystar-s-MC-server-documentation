# Trades

Trading is the only way to get various otherwise unobtainable items such as netherrack, bamboo, quartz or shulker shells. The trading system was added due to the lack of various items in the server's world.

## Trading

You can open the trading GUI by using the ``/trades`` command. There, you can trade items you have in your inventory for the items available in the trading GUI if you have enough space in your inventory. You can check what trades are available at any time by using the same command. You can also switch between pages using the icons at the bottom.

All of the trades are static and never change unless a server update is released. Such updates are announced in the apropriate news text channels on Discord.

## Troubleshooting

### Still missing some items

Did we miss some items? Contact me (Johnystar) on Discord and let me know!
