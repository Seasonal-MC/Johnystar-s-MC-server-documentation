# AuthMe

AuthMe is a plugin that allows players who don't have the money to pay for Minecraft to play too without potentially posing a security threat to our server. We even have an extension installed called FastLogin, so that our 'premium' players don't have to worry about having to enter their password everytime they join.

## Using the AuthMe authentication plugin

I will only go over this very quickly as this is already described in great detail in the "Joining the server" section.

### Registration

- use the ``/register {password} {password again}`` command
- you can only do this once and have to use a different command to change your password as unregistering is disabled on our server

### Logging in

- use the ``/login {password}`` command
- optionally you can enable auto-login (instruction on how to do that at the bottom)

### Changing your password

- use the ``/changepassword {old password} {new password}`` command
- if you forgot you password, DM me (Johnystar) on Discord and I'll help you resolve the issue when I'm online

## FastLogin (auto-login/premium)

If you're playing on a Minecraft account that you paid for, then you should to enable auto-login. This disables logging in with your username on offline/cracked clients thus giving you the ability to safely skip the login process!

**HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART**: If you don't do this, your progress will be tied to your in-game nickname instead of your purchased Minecraft account. In case you'd choose to change your nickname with premium disabled, you'd have to start all over again! More over, you should enable premium as soon as you start playing and then relogin as you there's a separate save file for your "offline" and "premium" login.

If you have any questions left regarding the potential progress loss, contact me via Discord.

In order to enable auto-login:

1. connect to the Minecraft server
2. use the ``/premium`` command
3. it will show you a warning the first time
4. after reading the important message it sends you, type ``/premium`` again to enable auto-login
5. **IMPORTANT** leave and rejoin the server after enabling premium!
6. to check you have premium enabled, type something in the in-game check and if you can see your skin in the #minecraft-chat text channel, then you're done

### Troubleshooting

If you're having problems with toggling premium it is necessary that you contact me as soon as possible and ideally don't play on the Minecraft server untill you receive further instructions.
