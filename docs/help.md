# Documentation isn't enough

If for whatever reason you've read through the whole documentation or at least all the reasonable places and your problem still somehow isn't resolved, then contact me (Johnystar) on Discord and I'll try to help you resolve your problem.

**PLEASE NOTE**: While I'm not planning on banning people for this, please make sure you're not wasting my time with stuff that's already well described here. If the documentation's confusing, that's fine, tell me and I'll try to make it better, but if you're just lazy, that's your problem.
