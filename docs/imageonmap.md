# ImageOnMap

ImageOnMap is a plugin that allows you to convert any online picture into a Minecraft map. **NOTE**: To use your own pictures, you have to upload them online somewhere. I recommend Imgur. **NOTE2**: Some image hosting services etc. won't work, as well as long links.

## Usage

### Creating a picture map

=> **please read the entire section before making a map** <=

To create a new map, use ``/tomap {url}`` which will give you a map with the picture the URL leads to. The image's resolution will be kept, thus usually creating huge maps. **You can resize your maps** by using the resize argument: ``/tomap {url} resize {width} {height}``. The units are in item frames. **DO NOT ISSUE THE SAME MAP SEVERAL TIMES**, instead refer to the section below.

### Browse and organise pictures

To browse pictures you created, use the ``/maps`` command. You can grab maps from this menu or put them back to discard them. To manage a specific picture, right click its map icon. Pictures can be renamed, deleted, and more.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure to read everything the plugin tells you: big maps must be placed in the lower left corner of a wall of item frames, etc...
