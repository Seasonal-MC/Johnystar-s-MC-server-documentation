# Chatting

The in-game Minecraft chat is designed to be a simple integration of the Discord chat in-game more than a full-fledged chatting system. Here's a short guide on how to chat no matter if you're in-game or not.

## Tagging/mentioning someone

No matter if you're on Discord or in-game, you can always tag someone by typing ``@{in-game nickname}``. On Discord, you just use the regular Discord auto-completion as you're already used to and in Minecraft, you just type ``@{in-game nickname}`` which then gets automatically converted on Discord thus mentioning the person you want. This is really easy thanks to player name synchronisation - more details in the in-game interface section.

## Whispering/DMs/PMs

On most servers you can use commands like ``/w`` or ``/tell``, however we prefer for the majority of our communication to happen on Discord directly, so these commands are unfortunately disabled in favour of Discord.
