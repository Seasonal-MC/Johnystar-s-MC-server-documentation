# World

(feel free to skip this paragraph) *I would like to start by mentioning that I've already gotten backlash in the past for not including Nether and The End and this time is no different. Unfortunately, I was unable to implement Nether and The End in a reasonable way, so in order to get certain items, you have to use the trading system.*

Now let's get to the documentation part!

## Dimensions

The world has only 1 dimension and that is the overworld, also reffered to as Earth as it is a 1:1000 recreation of it. You're free to live and build anywhere you want. Want Japan all to yourself? Sorry, that's already mine, but feel free to take Germany, France, England, Island... whichever territory you want, just **please make sure to discuss it on Discord first so that no conflicts occur**.

## Claiming land

As mentioned above, you're free to claim any territory as you wish **after discussing it with other members of the server on Discord**, however, there is no build protection. This server relies on trust, but don't worry too much in case griefers somehow get on to the server, we have CoreProtect installed. Check the security section for more information on that.

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting raided

If you're getting raided then contact me (Johnystar) on Discord and we'll resolve the conflict.
