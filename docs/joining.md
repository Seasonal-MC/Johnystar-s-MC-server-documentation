# Joining the server

## Prerequisites

**In order to be able to join and play on the server, you will need all of the following:**

- a copy (official or cracked) of Minecraft Java Edition version 1.14.4
- a Discord account with an email attached to it

### Minecraft client

You can connect with any vanilla or modded Minecraft client version 1.14.4. The only officially supported version is vanilla or client-side modded 1.14.4. If you encounter bugs while connected with a different version of Minecraft, please try connecting with vanilla 1.14.4. If something goes wrong, you will only get support if you're on 1.14.4 and even then only limited support if you have a non-vanilla client.

In order to run the most optimal version (vanilla 1.14.4) you will need:

- an operating system that can run Java
    - Windows (ideally Windows 10, but anything that can run Java's fine)
    - most Unix-like operating systems
        - Mac OS
        - Linux (Pop!_OS or Linux Mint recommended for beginners)
        - BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, ...)
        - other
    - any other OS that can run Java
- a Minecraft launcher
    - Mojang's official Minecraft launcher - downloadable from minecraft.net
    - MultiMC (recommended)
    - any other un/official or even cracked launcher (I do not condone playing illegally obtained versions of Minecraft)

### Discord

It is required for you to have a Discord account in order to play on the server. Your Discord account has to be linked before you can play. Your Discord account also needs to be associated with an email address.

## Connecting

Changing your nickname later on may cause problems. I highly recommend that you choose your nick now and keep it for at least as long as you plan on playing on the server.

### First time

The first time you connect to the server, a short setup is necessary before you can actually play.

1. join the official Discord server
2. launch Minecraft
3. add the Minecraft server to your Minecraft client's server list
4. connect to the Minecraft server
5. send the code you've been given as a DM to AuthBot on Discord as instructed by the server
6. connect to the Minecraft server again
7. register by using the ``/register {password} {password again}`` command
    - **IMPORTANT** If you have a paid account, you should activate PREMIUM (you're risking losing your progress otherwise) - more information in the security > AuthMe section.
8. done

### Joining again

1. launch Minecraft
2. connect to the Minecraft server
3. if you don't have auto-login/premium enabled, login using the ``/login {password}`` command

note: if you just toggled premium mode, you might have to relink your Discord account

## Troubleshooting

### Discord-related issues

Make sure to check out the security>DiscordSRV section.

### Forgotten password

If you forgot your password to the Minecraft server and don't have auto-login/premium enabled, then you need my help. Please contact me on Discord and I'll help you reset your password when I'm online.
