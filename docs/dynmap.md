# World map

Our server implements an awesome plugin known under the name "Dynmap". This plugin allows you to view the server's map as well as who's where and markers of various important places.

## Markers

### Creating a new marker

To make sure that no nonsense markers are made, if you want to add a marker to a new building you built and even potentially get featured in the ``#news-builds`` text channel then contact me (Johnystar) on Discord.

### Viewing markers

Markers are turned on by default and you can see them by looking around the map. If you wish to turn them off, you can do so in the layer menu available in the top-left corner right under the zoom (plus and minus) buttons.

## Players

You can see all currently online players and where they are on the map. This can be useful when you're trying to orient yourself.

## Troubleshooting

### Dynmap doesn't show up or something else shows up instead

Sometimes Dynmap may refuse to show up. If this ever happens:

- make sure that the Minecraft server is running (you can do this by checking that AuthBot is online on Discord)
- try refreshing the page (even several times)
- if none of the above works, contact me (Johnystar)
